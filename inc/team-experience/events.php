/**
 * Team Experience Analytics Events
 *
 * Thin emit helper for team-experience + artist-funnel analytics events.
 *
 * SHARED EVENT CONTRACT (Extra-Chill/extrachill-users#127)
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * The team-experience instrumentation spans three plugins
 * (extrachill-users, extrachill-studio, extrachill-roadie) plus the
 * artist-funnel work (extrachill-artist-platform#72). The event NAMES
 * and payload shape are a shared contract. Each plugin owns its own
 * emit helper and now defines its own event-name CONSTANTS (the names
 * it emits/reads) so a rename is mechanical within the plugin rather
 * than a scattered string edit (extrachill-users#129). Plugins use the
 * SAME event_type strings and the SAME `user_id`-in-payload convention
 * so the cohort rollups can join on the `extra_chill_team` role.
 *
 * Event types emitted by extrachill-users:
 *   - team_member_added        (ec_users_grant_team_role)
 *   - team_member_removed      (ec_users_revoke_team_role)
 *   - artist_access_requested  (request-artist-access ability)
 *   - artist_access_approved   (approve-artist-access ability)
 *
 * Event types emitted by sibling plugins (documented here for the
 * single-source contract — emitted in their own plugins):
 *   - extrachill-studio:  studio_draft_created, studio_submitted_for_review,
 *                         studio_transcription_run
 *   - extrachill-roadie:  roadie_session_started, roadie_tool_invoked
 *   - extrachill-artist-platform: artist_profile_created (sibling-owned)
 *
 * Payload convention: every event carries a `user_id` key in event_data
 * identifying the SUBJECT of the event (the user the action is about),
 * which may differ from the acting/authenticated user the analytics
 * table records in its own `user_id` column. This lets cohort rollups
 * join the subject against the `extra_chill_team` role regardless of who
 * triggered the action.
 *
 * All emits route through the existing `extrachill/track-analytics-event`
 * ability — never write the `c8c_extrachill_analytics_events` table
 * directly (RULES.md: use the ability).
 *
 * @package ExtraChill\Users
 * @since   0.18.0

/*
 * Event-name contract (Extra-Chill/extrachill-users#129).
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * The canonical event_type names are defined ONCE in extrachill-analytics
 * (inc/core/event-types.php) as the `EC_ANALYTICS_EVENT_*` constants plus
 * the `EC_ANALYTICS_TEAM_EXPERIENCE_EVENTS` / `EC_ANALYTICS_ARTIST_FUNNEL_EVENTS`
 * group constants. extrachill-analytics owns the analytics substrate and
 * the `extrachill/track-analytics-event` ability this helper already calls
 * at runtime, and is network-active, so those constants are guaranteed
 * present wherever this code runs — referencing them adds no new coupling.
 *
 * Every emit site and every reader in this plugin references the analytics
 * constants directly (no local copies of the literal strings), so a rename
 * happens in exactly one place across the whole network.
